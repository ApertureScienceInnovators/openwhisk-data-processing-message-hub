# OpenWhisk Getting Started - Data Processing MessageHub - IBM Developer Technology
This project provides sample code for creating your first MessageHub data processing app with Apache OpenWhisk on IBM Bluemix. It should take no more than 10 minutes to get up and running.

Once you complete this sample application, you can move on to more complex serverless application use cases.

To come.

# Installation
You will need a Bluemix account to work with the IBM hosted instance of Apache OpenWhisk.

## Sign up for a Bluemix account
Begin by going to [bluemix.net](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/) and signing up for a free account. After you activate your account, set an organization (for example, user@example.com) and space (for example "dev"), click on OpenWhisk in the left navigation.

## Execute `wskdeploy` to deploy the sample
Clone this repository to your system, and change to the root directory and install the app using the [`wskdeploy`](https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk-wskdeploy) tool, which uses a manifest to create the triggers, actions, and rules that power the sample.

```bash
./wskdeploy.sh
```

## Confirm that everything works
The code should show you how MessageHub data processing works.

# Troubleshooting
The first place to check for errors is the OpenWhisk activation log. You can view it by tailing the log on the command line with `wsk activation poll` or you can view the [monitoring console on Bluemix](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/openwhisk/dashboard).
